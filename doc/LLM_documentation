We used chatGPT to help us breakdown this project into phases to make it easier for us to divide up the work. 

The LLM gave use these phases to work with: 

Phase 1 — Understand the problem (in plain English)
Phase 2 — Core algorithm (no Scala yet)
Phase 3 — Architectural design
Phase 4 — Define your domain model
Phase 5 — The computational core
Phase 6 — Word stream (pipe)
Phase 7 — Production observer (console)
Phase 8 — Test observer
Phase 9 — Command line arguments (mainargs)
